\section{Block Cyclic Distribution with Modulo Unrolling}\label{sec:block_cyclic_modulo}

For the Chapel Block Cyclic implementation, both the leader and follower iterators have been modified to support the modulo unrolling optimization. Modulo unrolling, unaltered, is not compatible with the Block Cyclic distribution because consecutive array elements can reside on the same locale, which destroys the static locality information that we were able to use in the Cyclic distribution. The Block Cyclic leader iterator is now modified to choose slices of work such that the new "stride" is equal to the product of the block size and the cycle size. This way, when the work is passed to the follower iterator, elements that are in the same position within each block are guaranteed to be on the same locale. The follower iterator of the Block Cyclic distribution can now perform modulo unrolling in the same way as the Cyclic distribution.
