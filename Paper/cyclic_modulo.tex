\section{Cyclic Distribution with Modulo Unrolling}\label{sec:cyclic_modulo}

For the Cyclic distribution, only the follower iterator needs to be modified.\footnote{Aroon's comment: I am still working on a clear way to explain how modulo unrolling is implemented in both distributions without going into too much detail. Any suggestions on how I should do this?}
