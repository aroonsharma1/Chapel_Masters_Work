Chapel is a derivative of a number of parallel and distributed
languages and takes ideas directly from them, especially the MTA
extensions of C, HPF, and ZPL.

Chapel also takes many serial programming ideas from many other
programming languages, especially C\#, C++, Java, Fortran, and Ada.

The preparation of this specification was made easier and the final
result greatly improved because of the good work that went in to the
creation of other language standards and specifications, in particular
the specifications of C\# and C.
