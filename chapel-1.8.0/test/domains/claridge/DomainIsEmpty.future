feature request: isEmpty method for domains

Current methods make domain.numIndices==0 the simplest
query for whether a domain is empty, which doesn't look
look quite right.  For what it's worth, I say that from
having used this query a whole, whole lot.  It would also 
be nice to know that I can query for emptiness without 
expending the extra effort of calculating the precise 
number of elements.
