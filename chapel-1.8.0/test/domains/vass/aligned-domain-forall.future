bug: forall-iteration over a domain ignores the alignment of its ranges

Currently I get:

Dp  (1, 1)
Dp  (1, 4)

Ep  (1, 1)
Ep  (1, 4)

This might have the same fix as:
  users/ferguson/uint64_forall.chpl

Once this is fixed, need to fix .good for
  test/distributions/dm/t5a.chpl
currently by replacing "11 14" -> "32 35".
