feature request: external structs and routines

My sense is that external structs should be able to be passed to and
from external routines.  I don't think we should be changing returned
structs to arguments or inserting pointers (or copies) by default but
haven't had a chance to implement that yet.

This test differs from externFloat4calls by only declaring some of the
external fields within the Chapel code.  The intention was to make
sure that the unnamed fields weren't lost (which might suggest that
we're inserting copies that we shouldn't be).
