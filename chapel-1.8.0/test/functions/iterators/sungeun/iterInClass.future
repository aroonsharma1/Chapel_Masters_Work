bug: Iterator returning locale type gets internal error in resolveIntents

The test gets the following error for the getChildren() method.

  iterInClass.chpl:2: error: Unhandled type in blankIntentForType() [resolveIntents.cpp:59]

Note that this does not happen when there is only one class with a
method called getChildren().
