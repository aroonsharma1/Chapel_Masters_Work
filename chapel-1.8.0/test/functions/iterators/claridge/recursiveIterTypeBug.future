bug: Recursive iterator gets confused by a container class.

The compiler gets confused about the return type of the recursive
iterator 'traverse' when the argument is provided as the field of
a container class.  You wouldn't actually do this for a linked list,
but you would for a tree, and the list provides a simpler example.

The comments at the top of the code illustrate a couple of changes
that make the problem go away without altering the substance of
the program.
