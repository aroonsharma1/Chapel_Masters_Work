bug: segfault during execution under GASNET

I get this:

  *** Caught a fatal signal: SIGSEGV(11) on node 0/9
  NOTICE: Before reporting bugs, run with GASNET_BACKTRACE=1 in the environment to generate a backtrace.

under segment=everything; more nodes fail under segment=fast.

Works fine with comm=none.
NB need to unset LC_COLLATE or similar, to get consistent sort order.

When this bug is fixed, .skipif should be removed.
