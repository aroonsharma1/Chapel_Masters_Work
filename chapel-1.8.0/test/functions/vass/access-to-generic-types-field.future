feature request: provide access to the arguments of a generic type

If I have a generic type GT that I can create with
  GT(x=type1, y=type2)

I'd like to be able to deconstruct the resulting type,
retrieving its 'x' and 'y', e.g. GT(...).x.

Also - preserve this functionality through type aliases.
E.g. given
  type T = GT(x=type1, y=type2);
I'd like to deconstruct T, e.g. T.y == type2.

Similarly preserve it through the .type expressions, 'type' formals, etc.
