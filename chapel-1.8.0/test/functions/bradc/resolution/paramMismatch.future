error message: mark param value types

This error message is a placeholder for a problem J. Turner struggled
with at the beginning of the summer in which it appeared from the
current compiler output that resolution should be passing, but it was
not because a parameter value (like "10" in this example) was actually
a larger int than the function in question was calling for.  My
thought was that the error message could be clearer if the type of the
param value was indicated in the function call.  At the time I was
thinking this would be easy to do, but have never looked into it.

[Updated April 2013 because it was now resolving, presumably due to
improvements around param coercions.  Updated the test to a case
that's currently defined not to resolve in order to preserve the
original intent of the test and also added a .bad file.  Note that
this test is now the moral equivalent to smallIntParamCoerce.chpl, so
if the language semantics are changed to enable that case, this test
could be retired as well -- i.e., there would no longer be a need for
this type of error message to be improved; at least in this context
(and arguably any)].
