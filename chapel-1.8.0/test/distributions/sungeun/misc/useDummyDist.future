bug: Bug in function resolution results in unresolved type specifier for distribution under certain situations.

This is a stripped down version of the tests committed by Vass in
r19625.  If a distribution is used in a non-top-level scope *and* the
distribution module declares a domain that is dmapped using that
distribution, the compiler does not properly resolve the type
constructor for the distribution with no candidate notes.

NOTE: Replacing DummyDist with PrivateDist in useDummyDist.chpl
results in the same error.
