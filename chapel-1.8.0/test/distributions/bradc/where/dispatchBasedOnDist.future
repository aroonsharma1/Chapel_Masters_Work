feature request: ability to use where clauses on types of dists

This test shows syntax that seems like we should support (or something
close to it) to choose between implementations of a function based on
the distribution used.  For some reason that I am not completely
understanding -- perhaps because 'dist' is a method rather than a
member? -- it does not work today and results in an ambiguous call.
