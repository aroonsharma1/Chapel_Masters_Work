feature request: compiler option --show-config-params to show the config
                 params the compiler knows about

This would be useful if one were writing a program in which the initial
value of a variable depended on, for example, the details of the runtime
the program was being built with.  Having a list of the config params
would allow one to see how much information was available to use in
selecting that initial value.

What I'm most interested in here is a list of the parameters that are
predefined by the compiler, like CHPL_COMM.  It's not necessary to
include the parameters that are defined by the user on the compiler
command line, nor the ones that are defined in the source code to be
compiled.
