bug: when a leader iterator yields an array from within a task function, nil is dereferenced

This seems pretty similar to

  test/parallel/begin/vass/this-in-begin-in-method.future

I did not investigate.

For debugging, the test can be trimmed to just one iterator (except normlIter)
with just one task function.
