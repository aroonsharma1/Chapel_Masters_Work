feature request: profiling with line numbers

This test began failing due to a line number propagation issue which
Jacob hopes to get back to.

At present, this test does not even compile because standard/Profiling.chpl:

* contains this line:
     type RegionID = __primitive("_next_uint32");
  which should not be a 'type', but rather a 'param', for this to compile;

* contains calls to functions not defined in the current module, e.g.
   chpl_region_begin
   chpl_region_end
   etc.
  and since there is no single module that Profiling.chpl could 'use',
  this needs to be figured out.
  (E.g. the Region constructor could take those as arguments
   (as first-class functions) if the runtime cost of that is acceptable,
   or it could take an instance of some ProfileUser class,
   which would be defined in Profiling.chpl and subclassed by the user.)
