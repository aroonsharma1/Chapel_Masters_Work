bug: record within reduction class

For some reason, using a record within a reduction class breaks this
test.  My guess is that it's a bad interaction with memory management.
Replacing the record with its contents (as shown in
kmeaonsonepassreduction-minchange.chpl ) seems to be a reasonable
workaround for the time being.  Reductions should probably be
implemented within a Chapel module before we work on retiring this.
We could potentially add a warning if we thought this was going to be
a common case.
