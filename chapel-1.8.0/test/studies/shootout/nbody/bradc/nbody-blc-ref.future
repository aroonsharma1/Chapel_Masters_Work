feature request: ref declarations

At the time that we were discussing adding 'ref' intents, we discussed
the desire to also support standalone reference declarations, the idea
being that you should be able to do something like:

      ref a = A[i];

      a += 1;

as a means of modifying A[i] itself.  The idea was that if you can do
this by passing the expression to a procedure, you ought to be able to
do it without introducing a procedure.  In doing so, our assumptions
were that:

(1) a ref variable could not be pointed to something else.  That is,

      a = A[j];

would be equivalent to:

      A[i] = A[j];

not to pointing a to A[j]; and

(2) ref variables would not stack.  That is,

      ref b = a;

    would create a second alias to A[i], not a reference to the
    reference to A[i].


This future shows a case that would benefit from this.  I used an
inline proc in order to avoid recomputing/rewriting an expression like
A[i].  Supporting 'ref' declarations would be a more
straightforward/clean way of getting the same effect.
