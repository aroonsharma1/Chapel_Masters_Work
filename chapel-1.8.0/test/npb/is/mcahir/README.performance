The reference version of the largest size of IS we can run on a desktop (size C)
takes ~20 seconds to run.  Due to implementation issues, however, the Chapel
version (as of revision 21580) of IS takes more than 10x that to run the
algorithm, and more than 200x that for setup, the algorithm, and verification.

In an effort to minimize time taken for performance testing, we have disabled
size W, B, and C.  This is because size B and C take a very long time to
complete, and W takes enough time and provides no more relevant data than size
A.

We have also lowered the timeout to 400 seconds, since chap04's unusual
performance means that it will time out on 300 seconds.

Note: when the timeout was extended to 800 seconds, on bradc-lnx size C ran out
of memory instead of timing out or completing.  Because of this, we are
disabling it until we've written a better version of IS.
