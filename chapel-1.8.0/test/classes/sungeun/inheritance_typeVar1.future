bug: Cannot use type variable declared in parent class in member declaration of subclass.

This test declares a class A with a type variable (myType) and another
class B that is a subclass of A.  B has a member of type myType.

Compilation results in the following error message:

     inheritance_typeVar1.chpl:6: error: unresolved call 'B.myType'
     inheritance_typeVar1.chpl:2: note: candidates are: A.myType
