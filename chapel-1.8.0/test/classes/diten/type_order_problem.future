bug: compiler does not see a declaration because of textual order

While resolving 'var c = new C()', the compiler resolves 'class C'.
The latter contains a use of T, which is declared after 'var c'
and so is not visible, despite being defined prior to 'class C'.

At the very least the compiler should emit an intelligent error message,
e.g. "error: 'T' is defined after its enclosing class is used here".
