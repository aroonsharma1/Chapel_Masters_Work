bug: compiler reports an error incorrectly

The test code is legitimate, however I currently get:

  generic-parenthesesless-3.chpl:6: error: actual type is unknown or generic

It might be the case that the cause is the same as for the segfault in
generic-parenthesesless-1.chpl and generic-parenthesesless-2.chpl,
so maybe fix that first?

If the parentheses-less method is moved into the class or is made
non-parentheses-less, the compiler runs correctly.

See also: (minor) variations in other generic-parenthesesless-*.chpl
that trigger this or another error.
