feature request: 'accessing the locale of a local expression' on more exprs

When discussing test_dot_locale_error.chpl with Tom and Vass today,
we stumbled across the fact that expressions like 1.locale or 'on 1'
don't generate the same 'accessing the locale of a local expression'
warning that other non-lvalue expressions do.  The commit in r13756
suggests that all non-lvalue, non-class, non-locale expressions should
trigger this warning.  Not sure whether that capability eroded over
time or whether this case never worked.  (In super-ancient times, we
used this as a cheap bootstrapping mechanism before we introduced the
primitive that we use today, but I wouldn't think that's the reason...
In particular, the same behavior seems to occur with non-integer types).
