bug: deadlock in writeThis methods that use on clauses

This happens because the writer's lock contains the thread id to allow nested
write calls within it, but when we use on clauses, we create a new thread.  Not
sure about the fix.

history:

I'm not yet sure what the cause of this is, but it
seems to deadlock on multilocale runs.
