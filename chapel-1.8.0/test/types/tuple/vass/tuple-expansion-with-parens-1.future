bug: cannot assign a parenthesized tuple expansion expression

((...someTuple)) should be the same as someTuple, but currently
I get this for the line with 'q = ((...r))':

tuple-expansion-with-parens-1.chpl:2: error: unresolved call 'chpl__initCopy(int, int)'

which probably shows that ((...someTuple)), just like the bare (...someTuple),
just picks someTuple's first component.
