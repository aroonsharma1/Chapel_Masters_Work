semantic bug: Unnecessary copies of records lead to excessive calls of the record destructor

Ideally this program should only call the record destructor once, but
given our current default blank intent for records it gets called
every time the record gets passed into any function (at function
exit).

This problem could be solved either by optimization or by implementing
const ref as the default for blank record intents.
