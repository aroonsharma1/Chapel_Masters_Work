bug: a generic formal whose actual is a sync int gets the type 'int' when instantiating

Right now I get:

generic-sync-1.chpl:7: warning: int(64)
generic-sync-1.chpl:8: error: illegal lvalue in assignment

However, if I declare the 's' formal with 's: sync int', then compilerWarning
indicates the correct type (although see sync-type-1.future), I can assign it
inside test() and, indeed, the actual is passed in properly by reference.

Stripping off 'sync' when instantiating the generic does not make sense.
