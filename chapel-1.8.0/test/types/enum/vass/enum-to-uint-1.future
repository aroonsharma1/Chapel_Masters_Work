bug: an enum is not implicitly convertible to uint

The spec says: "An expression of an enumerated type can be implicitly
converted to an integral type, provided that all of the constants
defined by the enumerated type are representable by the integral type."

Therefore anything of the type e1 or e2 must be convertible to any uint.
But presently I get:

enum-to-uint-1.chpl:8: error: type mismatch in assignment from e2 to uint(8)
