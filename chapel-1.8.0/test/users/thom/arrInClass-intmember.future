semantic: array members in presence of user-defined constructor

This test gets an "zippering unequal lengths" error message, presumably
because the default constructor sets the array member up to be a 0
element array and we then try to assign a 3-element array into it in the
user constructor.  This semantic future asks whether that is what we
wish to happen given that the visible user code would seem to be legal
(if the default "safe" initializations were not quietly happening first).

This seems like yet another one of those "wish we had a way for an array
member to take its size from the thing being assigned to it" cases...
