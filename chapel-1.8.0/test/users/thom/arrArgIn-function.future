semantic: should exprs assignable to arrays be passable to in array args?

This test asks the question whether expressions that are legal to
assign to arrays should be legal actuals for formal arguments that
are of array type and in intent.  The argument would be that since
the array is in intent, the actual needs no lvalue and the argument
itself suggests an array's worth of storage.  The argument against
might be related to the reason that it isn't currently working.
