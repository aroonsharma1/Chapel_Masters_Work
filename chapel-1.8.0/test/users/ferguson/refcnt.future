Reference counting record test.

I'm pleased to see the effectiveness of overloading
the assign = operator and supplying a record 
destructor, but there are two problems.

First, I don't see how to bump the reference
count in the 'begin' statement. I'm not sure exactly
what I'm expecting out of the begin statement, but
I was expecting that there would be a method I could
override that would give me functionality like this:

var r:R;
begin {
 r.something();
}

turns in to ->
var r:R;
var _new_thread_r = beginCopy(r);
in new thread {
  _new_thread_r.~R()
}


Second, the copy initialization 2 test fails
because

var r_new = r;

never calls the overloaded assignment operator.
I don't see why it should not call the overloaded
assignment operator.
