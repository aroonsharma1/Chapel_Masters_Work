bug: isRecordType is implemented correctly on atomic types

This test is breaking also because sync/single vars are not passable
by ref intent. I put it here because it is a similar theme.
(isRecordType seems already correct for sync and single types
That but itself is covered in
  test/functions/vass/sync-by-ref.future

Currently I get:

type-tests.todo.chpl:5: warning: atomic is a class:  false
type-tests.todo.chpl:5: warning: atomic is a record: true
type-tests.todo.chpl:5: warning: atomic is a union:  false
type-tests.todo.chpl:10: error: non-lvalue actual passed to ref argument
type-tests.todo.chpl:10: error: non-lvalue actual passed to ref argument

(note an incorrect line number in the last two messages,
which should be Lines 6 and 7 instead).

Note on isRecordType for atomic types:
isRecordType() is a check for *Chapel*-level records.
Therefore it needs to return false for anything that (a) is declarable
with the 'atomic' keyword or (b) is treated by the compiler specially.
At the moment, it seems isRecordType can be adjusted for atomic types
by providing an isAtomicType() function. The latter could be implemented
e.g. like _isUnsignedType(), by comparison of the argument against all
valid atomic types.

As the issues are fixed, please move the test/.good code into type-tests.chpl.
