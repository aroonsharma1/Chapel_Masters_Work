error message: in the developer mode, error messages for internal failures
need to indicate that those are internal failures.

Right now I get "internal failure CAL0035" in the user mode but the following
in the developer mode:
  internal-error-message.chpl:90: error: actual type is unknown or generic [callInfo.cpp:35]

This is misleading because the developer mode message looks like
it arises from a bug in the user code.  Should be "error: internal failure"
in both user and developer modes.

Remark: it does not matter which particular internal failure is
causing such an error message. Even if this particular test example
generates a different internal failure or (ideally) none at all,
this error message request still holds.

The source code, internal-error-message.chpl, is of no significance on its own.
Anything that generates an internal compiler failure would illustrate this.
