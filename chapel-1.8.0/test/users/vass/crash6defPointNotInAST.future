bug: compiler crashes with "SymExpr::var::defPoint is not in AST"

It complains about the first use of 'bd' in backwardSubVerifyLocal like:
  crash6defPointNotInAST.chpl:29: error: SymExpr::var::defPoint is not in AST [expr.cpp:220]

If I remove that use (or uncomment an earlier use), the complaint/
crash moves to the other point.

Seems like the deadCodeElimination pass removes the definition of 'bd'
(because it follows the 'return' statement) but does not remove
the uses of 'bd'.
