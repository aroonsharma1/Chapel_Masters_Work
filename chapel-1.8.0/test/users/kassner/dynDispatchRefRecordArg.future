bug: Dynamic dispatch with 'ref' record arguments fails to work

This test shows that passing a record argument by 'ref' as a method
to dynamic dispatch fails to work.  

Changing the argument to 'inout' doesn't seem to help, so it probably
can't be blamed on the new-ness of 'ref' arguments as I initially
thought.

A workaround is to compile with --conditional-dynamic-dispatch-limit
set >= 2.

Looking at the generated code, it seems that we copy the record a few
times before taking a reference and passing it to the method, and that
as a result, we end up modifying one of the copies rather than the
original variable.
