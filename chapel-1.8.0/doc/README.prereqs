====================================
Chapel Prerequisites and Assumptions
====================================

If you have a standard UNIX environment, a C/C++ compiler, some basic
scripting languages, a GNU-compatible make, and awk installed you should
have no problems getting started with Chapel.   

In slightly more detail the following are prerequisites and assumptions
about your environment for using Chapel:

* You are using an environment that supports standard UNIX commands
  such as: cd, mkdir, rm, echo, bc

* You have the Bourne shell available at /bin/sh, the C-shell
  available at /bin/csh, 'env' available at /usr/bin/env, and that
  'env' can locate Perl and Python on your system.

* You have access to gmake or a GNU-compatible version of make and awk.

* You have access to standard C and C++ compilers. We typically
  compile our code using gcc/g++ (at least version 3.3.0.) We have also
  had some experience using Clang. Additionally we have compiled our
  code using compilers by Cray, IBM, Intel, and PGI. Any standard C and
  C++ compiler should work, but the aforementioned are the ones we have
  the most experience with.
