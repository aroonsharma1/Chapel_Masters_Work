CF machines
===========
chap01 : linux64 (comm none, default everything)
chap02 : gasnet: segment fast (M,W,F,Su), segment everything (Tu,Thu,Sa)
chap03 : linux64 performance (comm none, default everything) -- old HW
chap04 : linux64 performance (comm none, default everything) -- new HW
chap05 : qthreads (comm none examples, gasnet multilocale-examples)
chap06 : --baseline
chpbld01 : XT/XE PrgEnvs examples, nightly
chpbld02 : XT/XE PrgEnvs all, weekly
chpbld03 : (no testing - non-standard: RHEL5.7 with Tilera PCI card)
chpbld04 : (no testing - non-standard: RHEL5.7 with Tilera PCI card)
cflbs32  : linux32 (comm none, default everything)

Seattle machines
================
chap09    : valgrind (comm none)
chap10    : --no-local
bradc-lnx : 11pm update of ~chapelu/chapel, release testing, linxu64 performance, token count, tab check
lnx-vass  : block, memory leaks; historify-logs
lnx-hilde : (no testing)
lnx-diten : cyclic
macchapel-mac            : mac (still a bit fishy)
4LR97C1 (windows laptop) : cygwin (typical windows network weirdness)

Discontinued testing
====================
- opts   (start_opt_test, nightly-opts-all.cron, nightly-opts-examples.cron)
- mpi    (was: nightly.chap04     up to r19116)
- tcmalloc (comm none, gasnet multilocale-examples, preserved as nightly.tcmalloc)
- XMT (was nightly.chap07, preserved as nightly.xmt)


Other notes
===========

start_opt_test
--------------

Currently unused - in part because there were always holes and there
wasn't a good diffing system as with the normal nightly runs. So
sifting through logs to see what was changing required a lot of
human effort. We keep it around in hopes of resurrecting it.

crontab entry format
--------------------

* * * * * command to be executed
- - - - -
| | | | |
| | | | ----- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0) (3-letter names are allowed?)
| | | ------- month (1 - 12)
| | --------- day of month (1 - 31)
| ----------- hour (0 - 23)
------------- min (0 - 59)
'*' in a given position means "any".
