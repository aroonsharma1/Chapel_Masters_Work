error message: const indices

I believe that index variables should be constant to avoid
confusion in believing that they are a single variable
shared by multiple iterations rather than a private
per-iteration variable.

As Steve proposed at today's meeting, if the iterator is a
var iterator, the index would be a variable; if the iterator
is a const iterator, it would be a variable.
