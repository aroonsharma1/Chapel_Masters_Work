semantic: invoke user-defined record constructor if available

Upon a variable declaration of a record type and with no initializer,
determine which constructor to invoke as if resolving the constructor
call in 'new RECORDTYPE()'. In other words, if there are user-defined
constructors, those should be considered using the standard resolution
rules and the default constructor should not be considered.

(Downside: this will force the user to write a zero-argument
constructor (or a constructor that would be invocable upon 'new
RECORDTYPE()') if the program has any other user-defined constructors
and a 'var VARNAME:RECORDTYPE;' declaration.)

Note 1: at present, the default constructor is invoked
even in the presence of a no-argument user constructor.

Note 2: TODO: extend this approach to generic records.
