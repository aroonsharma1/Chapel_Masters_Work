bug: array and function at same scope doesn't cause a problem

This test defines an array and a function with the same name at the
same scope.  I believe that this should cause problems either at the
point where the second is declared or during the scopeResolve pass.
(Declaring two arrays with the same name suggests the latter, and
is also where I got the proposed output in the .good -- I'd be fine
with some other clear wording as well).

In any event, I don't believe it should cause one to be chosen
arbitrarily as is currently the case.

I'm a bit surprised by this one and sure hope that there isn't a
reason we need the current behavior that I'm forgetting...
