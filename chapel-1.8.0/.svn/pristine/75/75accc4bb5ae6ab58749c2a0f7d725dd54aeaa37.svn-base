bug: printing a multi-d array where one of the dimension ranges has a negative stride misplaces a newline

Right now I get:

---
0 0 0 00 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0

---

for writeln(A) and writeln(C) and 

---
0 0 0 00 0 0 0

---

for writeln(X). Instead, I should get 4 and 2, resp., lines of 4 zeros.

BTW we should test the same for 3/4-d arrays.
