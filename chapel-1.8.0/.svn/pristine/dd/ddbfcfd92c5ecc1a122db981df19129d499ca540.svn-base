The robustness tests are contained in the following directories based
on functionality tested:

  basics/      basic domain and array functionality, e.g., iteration
  collapsing/  rank change slicing in which dimensions are collapsed
  composite/   combinations of functionality in other directories
  kernels/     small kernels, e.g., jacobi
  modules/     tests of calling standard module functions on arrays and domains
  reindexing/  reindexing
  resizing/    changing a domain so that the array is resized
  slicing/     slicing
  stress/      stress tests, e.g., creating many distributed arrays in a loop
  trivial/     trivial domain and array functionality, e.g., A.eltType

Each directory should contain a NUMLOCALES file with the value 4 (or
some other appropriate value) and a COMPOPTS file with the line
"-M../" so that the test can use the driver module located in this
directory.


USING AND RUNNING THE SUITE

The top-level file driver.chpl defines an enum type called DistType.
Currently, default, block, cyclic, and blockcylic are supported.  To
test a new distribution, add a new enum type and add the appropriate
initialization for your distribution in the procedure
setupDistributions().  When compiling a test, specify
'-sdistType=myNewDist' on the command line, where myNewDist is the
name of the enum type for your new distribution.  To run the entire
suite using your new distribution with start_test, specify -compopts
'-sdistType=DistType.myNewDist' on the command line.

By default, the test suite uses the default (single locale) distribution
when $CHPL_COMM is 'none', and Block distribution otherwise.
