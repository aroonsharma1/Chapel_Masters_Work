bug: param function with declared type doesn't create param value

NOTE: I believe this is the same as functions/vass/paramret-1.future

This code should behave identically to paramfn.chpl, but doesn't
seem to.  Instead it captures the result of the param function
as an empty string for some reason.  May have to do with how we
implement non-inferred types by capturing a value of the declared
type in the IR?
