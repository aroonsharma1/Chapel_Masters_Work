bug: Confusing error message simple case of inheritance.

This test is exactly like inheritance_noUse_param3.chpl, except it
calls writeln(a) before delaring b.

      inheritance_noUse_param4.chpl:5: error: unresolved type specifier 'B(x=10)'
      inheritance_noUse_param4.chpl:5: note: candidates are: B
      inheritance_noUse_param4.chpl:5: note: did you forget the 'new' keyword?

I don't know what this is supposed to mean.
