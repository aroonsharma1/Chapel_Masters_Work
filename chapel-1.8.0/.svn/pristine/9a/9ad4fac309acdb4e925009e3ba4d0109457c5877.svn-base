bug: "unresolved call" error should not be reported, whereas it is when a dynamically-dispatched method has a param argument

Currently I get:

generic-method-with-param-arg-2.chpl:18: In function 'getAllocationDomainForDefaultRectangularArray':
generic-method-with-param-arg-2.chpl:21: error: unresolved call 'BaseArr.getAllocationDomainForDefaultRectangularArray(3)'

Various observations:

* Originally, this code was spread over relevant files in modules/internal,
e.g. ChapelDistribution.chpl, DefaultRectangular.chpl, etc.
In that setting, as of -r19391, the compilerAssert() would fail.
If the compilerAssert were commented out, the compiler would crash
with an internal error at EXP0191. Not sure what makes its behavior
different in the current setup.

* When the compiler is passed --explain-call getAllocationDomainForDefaultRectangularArray,
it prints this:

  generic-method-with-param-arg-2.chpl:21: note: call: BaseArr.getAllocationDomainForDefaultRectangularArray(3)

twice. The first time it finds visible functions etc. and resolves it alright; the second time it finds no visible functions. Seems like a bug.

* FYI, seems like the compiler creates a method

  BaseArr.getAllocationDomainForDefaultRectangularArray()

as a statically-dispatched wrapper for dynamic dispatch, from which

  DefaultRectangular.getAllocationDomainForDefaultRectangularArray()

is invoked when needed.

* Inside one of the compiler-generated clones (probably the one mentioned
right above) of getAllocationDomainForDefaultRectangularArray, I observed
that another getAllocationDomainForDefaultRectangularArray is passed the
'rank' param. However, by that time, 'rank' has already been eliminated
when specializing the method, and so is no longer available.

So maybe the bug is merely that instead of passing 'rank' we should
pass its corresponding value?
