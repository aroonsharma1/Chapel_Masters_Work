semantic: 'type int' as formal type

This test uses idioms like 'type int' in a formal argument list
which could arguably be a sugar for 'type x ... where x == int'.
The compiler accepts it which suggests that that may be how we
treat it.  But then it treats the two calls here as ambiguous
which seems incorrect.  bool values can coerce to ints, but
bool types should not coerce to int types.
