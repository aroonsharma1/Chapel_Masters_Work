bug: Cannot use param declared in parent class in member initialization in subclass.

This test declares a class A with a param x and another class B that
is a subclass of A.  B has a member y that is initialized to x.

Compilation results in the following error message:

     inheritance_param1.chpl:6: error: unresolved call 'B.x'
     inheritance_param1.chpl:2: note: candidates are: A.x
