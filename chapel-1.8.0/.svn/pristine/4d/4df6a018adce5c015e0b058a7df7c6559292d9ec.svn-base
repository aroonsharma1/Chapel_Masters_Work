bug: this idiom generates a gcc warning for some reason (error w/ -Werror)

This is a reduced case from mandelbrot-fancy.chpl, which has been
failing its performance test since it was established due to the
presence of the --fast flag.

If we chose to, we could disable this warning using
-Wno-strict-overflow, or we could disable the optimization that is
triggering the warning using -fwrapv or -fno-strict-overflow (see
stackoverflow Q&A at:

     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12984861/dont-understand-assuming-signed-overflow-warning

for more detail).  

Yet it seems beneficial to understand better what is causing this
behavior, and why it is unique to this test, rather than simply
disabling it.  Offhand, I can't even recall whether we rely on integer
overflow in our range iterators.
