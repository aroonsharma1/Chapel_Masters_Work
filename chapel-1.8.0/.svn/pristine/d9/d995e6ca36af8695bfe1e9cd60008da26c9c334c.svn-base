bug: "unresolved call" error should not be reported, whereas it is when a dynamically-dispatched method has a param argument

See also generic-method-with-param-arg-2.future.

Currently I get:

generic-method-with-param-arg-1.chpl:1: In function 'getAllocationDomainForDefaultRectangularArray3':
generic-method-with-param-arg-1.chpl:5: error: unresolved call 'BaseArr.getAllocationDomainForDefaultRectangularArray3()'

This test is a simplification of generic-method-with-param-arg-2.chpl
by replacing the 'rank' param argument with '3' in the method name.
(The '3' in the method name is inconsequential.)
