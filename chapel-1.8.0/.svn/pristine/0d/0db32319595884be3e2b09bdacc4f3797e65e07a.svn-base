bug: User-defined initCopy routines are ignored in removedUnnecessaryAutoCopyCalls.

If the user defines a version of chpl__initCopy() which overrides the
compiler-defined version, the user's version should always be called.

Right now, it is being replaced by a _move, unless the --no-remove-copy-calls
compiler flag is specified.
