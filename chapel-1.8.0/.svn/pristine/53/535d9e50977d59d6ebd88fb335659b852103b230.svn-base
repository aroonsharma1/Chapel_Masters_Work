bug: compiler crashes with an internal error on a compilerWarning

I get:

  error: assertion error [functionResolution.cpp:1510]

Even if any 2 of the 3 lines are commented out.

Actually I am not sure what the right compiler behavior is.
compilerWarning should be invoked with the last argument
either a string or an integer. In this case it's neither.
So maybe the compiler should say "must be a string or an int"
for each line of this test program.
