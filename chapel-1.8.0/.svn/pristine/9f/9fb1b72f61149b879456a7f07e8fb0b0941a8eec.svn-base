error message: nil opaque bounds checking

It would be nice to customize the opaque bounds checking error message
for the case when the index is nil since it's difficult to reason
about "bounds" in an opaque domain/array context (though this error
message would still pertain if the index of one opaque domain was used
to access an opaque array defined over a disjoint opaque domain.
