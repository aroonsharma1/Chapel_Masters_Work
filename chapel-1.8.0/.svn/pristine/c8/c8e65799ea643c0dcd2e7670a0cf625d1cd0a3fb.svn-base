bug: atomics not passed to constructors by ref by default

In order to get atomics passed by ref correctly for GASNet without
breaking array construction and arrays of atomics, I had to make them
not be passed by ref to constructors.  This future demonstrates this
behavior as a placeholder to fix and address this later on, to avoid
surprises and inconsistencies in the language (or at least to
rationale it better if it must be this way).
