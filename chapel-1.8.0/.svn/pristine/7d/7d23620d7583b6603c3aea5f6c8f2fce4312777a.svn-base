bug: reading tuple type

Although the new QIO system supports the ability to read a given type
(e.g., read(int)), it seems that it does not permit this type to be a
tuple type (e.g., read((int, int))).  However, through the use of
varargs type functions, it does support the following as a workaround:
read(int, int).  That said, I think that for orthogonality, it should
support reading a single tuple type as well, so this bug checks for
that.
