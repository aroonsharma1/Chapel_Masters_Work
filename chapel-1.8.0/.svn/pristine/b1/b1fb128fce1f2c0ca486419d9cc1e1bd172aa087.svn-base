bug: memory corruption observed under GASnet

To be investigated. This is what is known so far:

This runs OK with
* CHPL_COMM=none, or
* --no-local, or
* -s noRefCount=true.

With CHPL_COMM=gasnet I get this output:

  setting up for 2*2 locales
  n = 62
  blkSize = 8
  AbD = [1..62, 1..63]
  starting offsets = 1, 1

  initABref is using a random seed
  /users/vass/chapel/modules/dists/BlockCycDist.chpl:439: error: attempt to dereference nil

valgrind --suppressions=bc.supp --trace-children=yes a.out -nl 4
  where bc.supp is included in this directory
  and assuming chpl compilation with -s verbose=true
produces the following:

---
reproducible=false  verbose=true

target locales =

n = 62
