feature request: do not evaluate (at run time) the argument to .type

This test argues that the argument to .type should not be evaluated
at run time.

This is a matter of definition. Currently, if the argument to .type is
a function call, the compiler seems to be consistent in generating
code to make that call at runtime.

However, this is inconsistent with .type being a compile-time expression.
Therefore I propose to define (and implement) .type as
a purely compile-time construct, with no run-time effects.
