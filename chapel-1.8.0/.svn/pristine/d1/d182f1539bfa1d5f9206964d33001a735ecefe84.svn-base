bug: Param loop over tuple of tuples results in internal compiler error.

This is a simplified version of a function that Brandon Holt wrote for
his Lulesh code.  It appears that the tuple of tuple causes the
following assertion in replaceLocalsWithField():

            INT_ASSERT(tmp->type->refType);

The refType is NULL because the type itself is a reference.

Brandon replace the the tuple of tuples with a 2D array as a workaround.
