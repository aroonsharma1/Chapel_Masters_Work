feature request: extern functions w/ default args and return values

Default arguments work on extern functions with little or no work
on our part (see defaultArgs.chpl).  However, if the extern function
returns a value, the wrapper we create doesn't preserve the return
value appropriately, unfortunately.  This seems like it should not
be too hard to support, but if I'm wrong then we should flag a
more specific error (like "extern functions with default arguments
cannot return values?")
