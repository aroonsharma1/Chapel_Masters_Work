bug: 'domain' is not treated as a generic type in var field declarations

Currently I am getting:
  generic-domain-field.chpl:2: syntax error: near ';'

But 'domain' is a generic type, so the class declaration is legal:
the 'x' field is generic, making the class C generic, too.

Cf. writeDom is correctly treated as a generic method. Also our code
works if we replace 'domain' with a user-defined generic class, e.g.
  class G { type t; }
  class C { var x: G; } // 'x' is generic, and so is 'C'

Arguably the right fix is to make 'domain' not a keyword, see
