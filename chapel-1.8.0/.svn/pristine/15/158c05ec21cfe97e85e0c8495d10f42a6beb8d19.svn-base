MassiveThreads README for Chapel
================================

This copy of MassiveThreads is being released with Chapel for
convenience and uses a snapshot obtained from the MassiveThreads
team at:

   http://code.google.com/p/massivethreads/

We have applied the following configuration settings for Chapel users
for simplicity:

* disabled the internal malloc wrapper (alternative:CHPL_MEM=tcmalloc)

* disabled worker thread binding with CPU (can be enabled at runtime
  by setting an environmental varibale MYTH_BIND_WORKERS=1)

* disabled the experimental scheduler
