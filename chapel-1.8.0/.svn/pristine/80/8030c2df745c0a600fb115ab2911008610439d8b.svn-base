bug: sync variable is deleted prematurely when passed by ref and used in 'begin'

See:
  autodestroy-with-begin-1.future


autodestroy-with-begin-ref.chpl:

It is a variation on autodestroy-with-begin-1.chpl that specifies
the 'ref' intent explicitly for the sync variable formals.

This behavior should be identical to blank intent, but currently
it triggers an unimplemented case in the compiler:

  autodestroy-with-begin-ref.chpl:14: error: unexpected case [parallel.cpp:578]

I think there is a separate future for the above issue.  Once that issue
is addressed, this test can perhaps still be retained.
