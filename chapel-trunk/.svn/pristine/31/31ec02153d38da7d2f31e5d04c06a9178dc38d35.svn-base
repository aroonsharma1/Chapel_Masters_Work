bug: Invalid extern declaration in class results in internal error in function resolution.

This test essentially parallel/taskPar/sungeun/private.chpl except
that the extern declaration is accidentally placed at the class-level
in localePrivateData.  I made a few attempts to make this example
simpler, but the simpler examples don't seem to work.
