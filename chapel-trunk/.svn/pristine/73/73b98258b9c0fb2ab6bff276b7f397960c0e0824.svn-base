bug: Destructor called too many times for a record var with explicit new.

A record variable at module scope is initialized with an explicit new.  The
user's default constructor is called, but the destructor is called twice.  This
would be an error with a reference-counted type, since it could lead to
double-deletion unless the reference counting implementation protects for this
internally.
