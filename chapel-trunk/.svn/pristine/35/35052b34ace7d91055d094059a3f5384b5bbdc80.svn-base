bug: alignment is not printed for certain unambiguously-aligned ranges

Right now, the expression:  .. by 3 align 0  is printed out as:  .. by 3
                           ..7 by 3 align 1                     ..7 by 3

which is misleading, because the expressions printed out
are ambiguously aligned in Chapel, while the expressions
causing those printouts are not.
