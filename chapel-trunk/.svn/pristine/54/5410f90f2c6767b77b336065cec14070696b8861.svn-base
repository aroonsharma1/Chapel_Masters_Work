bug: untyped array initialization via forall does not preserve the forall's domain map

When I write

    var A = [D] 0;

I expect A to have the same domain - and the same domain map - as D.
Right now A gets the default domain map.

In the test code specifically, I get:

initialization-mapped-1.chpl:9: warning: domain(1,int(64),false)
initialization-mapped-1.chpl:10: error: assert failed

Note: the formatting of the domain type, as well as the _value field,
is currently implementation-specific and may change.
