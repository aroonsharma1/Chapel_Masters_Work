bug: cast to non-type is not flagged as an error

At the moment the compilation succeeds, with the compiler
printing out the warning:
    cast-to-non-type-2.chpl:3: warning: c: string

Instead it should flag the declaration of 'c' as an error
because t does not refer to a type.

Seems like we get the same behavior when t's type is any integer
or string, but not when it is real.

An integer case is in cast-to-non-type-1.*
