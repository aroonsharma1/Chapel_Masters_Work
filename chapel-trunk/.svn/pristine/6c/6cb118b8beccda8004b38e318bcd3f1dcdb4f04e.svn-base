# If verification is turned on, the structural error checkNoWrapperMoves
# [checks.cpp:549] will trigger if an assignment that returns a value is used
# in the program.  That changes the output of the program, so we just skip the
# tests if --verify is tossed.
# The move is inserted by insertReturnTemps() [functionResolution.cpp:6225],
# which makes good sense in that context.  So the insertion of a wrapper move
# does not mean there is a flaw in the compiler.
# We could have a separate test to show that the check is working, but checks
# are just a debugging feature: they don't get full support.
# We could have a separate .good file for when the --verify flag is tossed, but
# that is not yet supported.
COMPOPTS <= --verify
