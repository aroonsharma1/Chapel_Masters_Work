bug: Confusing error message simple case of inheritance.

This test is exactly like inheritance_noUse_typeVar1.chpl, except it
calls new B();

     inheritance2.chpl:5: error: unresolved type specifier 'B(myType=type real)'
     inheritance2.chpl:5: note: candidates are: B
     inheritance2.chpl:5: note: did you forget the 'new' keyword?

I don't know what this is supposed to mean.
