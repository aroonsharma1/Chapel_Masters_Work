Subversion repositories
=======================

Repository
------------
The subversion repository for the project is set up as follows:

* URL: svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/chapel/code
         branches/
           collaborations/      -- used for external collaborators
           release/             -- used to capture release branches
         tags/                  -- used to tag releases
         third-party-norelease/ -- third party code not intended for release
         trunk/                 -- our main development branch ($CHPL_HOME)

* Anyone can read the repository.

* To commit to the repository, you'll need a SourceForge account and
  permissions granted by a Chapel administrator.  See
  CommittingCode.txt in this directory for further details.


SVN "cheat sheet" (with comparisons to git)
-------------------------------------------

* Get online help (more complete/detailed/verbose than this):
  - svn help [<command>]
  - Gives general help or help on a specific command

[Note that in most of the following commands, failing to give a
file/dir argument causes the command to default to the current working
directory ('.').  These commands can typically be executed from within
any SVN subdirectory.]

* Update to HEAD: (this is what you'll typically want to use)
  - svn update [<file/dir>]
  - Similar to: git pull origin master (or whatever branch you're on)   

* Update to a specific revision number:
  - svn update -r<revision number> [<file/dir>]
  - Similar to: git checkout <commit hash>

* Add a file/dir to the repo:
  - svn add <file/dir>
  - Similar to: git add <file/dir>

* Delete a file/dir: 
  - svn rm <file/dir>
  - Similar to: git rm [-r] <file/dir>

* Move a file/dir:
  - svn mv <origfile/origdir> <file/dir>
  Similar to: mv (git handles this automatically)

* Copy a file/dir:
  - svn cp <origfile/origdir> <file/dir>
  - Similar to: cp (git handles this automatically)

* Get the staus of files/directories:
  - svn status [-v] [<file/dir>]
  - Similar(ish) to: git status

* Diffing: (look at man pages for this)
  - svn diff [<file/dir>]
  - Similar to: git diff

* Reverting a file: 
 - svn revert <file>
 - Similar to: git checkout <file>

* Commiting a file/dir:
  - svn commit -m <message> [<file/dir>]
  - Similar to: git add <file/dir>
                git commit -m <message>
                git push origin master

* Merging: 
  - svn merge
  - Similar to: git merge

* Overwriting the commit message on an existing revision:
  - svn propset -r <rev#> --revprop svn:log -F <my_new_message_file>
