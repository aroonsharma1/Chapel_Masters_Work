bug: sync variables need to be passable by reference to generic formals

Right now I get (notice also an inadequate line number):

  sync-by-ref.chpl:5: error: non-lvalue actual passed to ref argument [functionResolution.cpp:2348]

Seems like it comes from function resolution: it passes an int,
rather than a sync int.

Cf. passing the sync var to proc test2(ref ccc: sync int) works fine.
