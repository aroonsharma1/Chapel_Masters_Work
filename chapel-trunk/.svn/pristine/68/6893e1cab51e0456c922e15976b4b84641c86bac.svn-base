bug: name clash of global variables in the generated code with mathcalls.h

Currently I get these during from the C compiler:

chpl__header.h:1574: error: ‘drem’ redeclared as different kind of symbol
/usr/include/bits/mathcalls.h:208: error: previous declaration of ‘drem’ was here

etc.

The conflicts come from #include <math.h> in runtime headers.
We should look through the documentation for math.h for a complete list
of names to avoid in the generated code.


TODO: there are more symbols in
  /usr/include/unistd.h
that we need to avoid. Examples:
  access
  euidaccess
  eaccess
  faccessat
  lseek
  lseek64
  close
  read
  write
  pread
  pwrite
  pread64
  pwrite64
  pipe
  pipe2
  sleep
  ualarm
  usleep
  pause
  chown
  fchown
  lchown
  fchownat
  chdir
  fchdir
  getcwd
  get_current_dir_name
  dup
  dup2
  dup3
  environ
  execve
  fexecve
  execv
  execle
  execl
  execvp
  execlp
  execvpe
  nice
  pathconf
  fpathconf
  sysconf
  confstr
  getpid
  getppid
  getpgrp
  getpgid
  setpgid
  ... well you get the idea
