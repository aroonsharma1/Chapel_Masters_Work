bug: Array values are permitted to be detupled in iterator

This test shows that someone forgetful (like me) who doesn't
use the zip keywork and ends up iterating over a tuple of
arrays rather than a zippered iteration of the arrays may
not get a warning that would help them since they shouldn't
be able to store the array in a detupled index variable
(in my opinion anyway).

Looking at ChapelArray.chpl, it appears that we still permit
tuples to be assigned to arrays (which used to be out of
necessity when we didn't have array literals and I think
should be retired), yet removing this doesn't help with the
issue.  Suggesting that maybe there's special case code in
the compiler that's causing this to pass when it shouldn't?
