bug: Cannot have begin statements in chpl__initCopy() or anything called from it

Due to the implicit sync around main, all begin statements require the
global _endCount var for this sync, which requires it to be passed
through all enclosing calls.

This test asserts during the removeUnnecessaryAutoCopyCalls pass as it
checks to make sure that initCopy and autoCopy take no more than 1
argument.
