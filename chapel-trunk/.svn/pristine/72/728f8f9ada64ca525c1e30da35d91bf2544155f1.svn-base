bug: _isSyncType misfires on single types

Once this bug is resolved, please:

* remove the second and third variants of test() from type-tests.todo.chpl:

 proc test(param msg, ref v: sync) ...
 proc test(param msg, ref v: single) ...

leaving only the first variant proc test(param msg, ref v)...

* adjust .bad correspondingly - it will need two extra lines like this:

type-tests.todo.chpl:10: error: non-lvalue actual is passed to 'ref' formal 'v' of test()

* the .good should remain unchanged

* restore this .future to what's below the line

bug: sync and single vars need to be passable to ref-intent generic formals

This test (type-tests.todo.chpl) actually is to verify correctness of
_isSync/Type and _isSingle/Type

However, I made it into a .future because it currently does not work
the way I'd like it to work, i.e. using the first variant of test():

  proc test(param msg, ref v) ...

because of the bug that's explicitly exercised by

  test/functions/vass/sync-by-ref.future

which is that I get:

type-tests.todo.chpl:10: error: non-lvalue actual passed to ref argument
type-tests.todo.chpl:10: error: non-lvalue actual passed to ref argument

(note an incorrect line number in the last two messages,
which should be Lines 6 and 7 instead).

As the issues are fixed, please move the test/.good code into type-tests.chpl.
