semantic: allow void-typed variables and fields

A void-typed variable means:
* no space is allocated for it at runtime
* it may not be assigned
* its value may not be used in any way
   - it might be marginally OK to assign one void variable to another

Rationale (championed by Brad): allow space to be allocated or not
depending on a param condition.  For example, an instance of the class 'c'
in void-variable-def.chpl has the field 'v' if 'enabled' is true
and does not allocate space for 'v' if 'enabled' is false,
thus controlling the size of the 'c' instances with a param flag.
