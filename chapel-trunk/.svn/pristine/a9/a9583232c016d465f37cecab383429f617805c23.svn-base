bug: When a record variable declaration has an explicit type and an initializer, and the record has 'const' field(s), it should be legal but an error is reported.

For now, the workaround is to omit the explicit type.
A compilerAssert for the variable's type could be added
separately, if desired.
Another workaround, although probably not as good,
is to change 'const' fields to 'var' in that type.
