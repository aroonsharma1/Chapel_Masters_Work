bug: passing tuple to extern function passes stack trash

If a is a tuple, and I pass a[1] to an extern function by reference,
I expect the rest of the tuple to be stored in contiguously allocated
memory. That's not happening in this test case - instead, a[1] is
stored in its own stack variable, e.g. a_1, and &a_1 is passed.
