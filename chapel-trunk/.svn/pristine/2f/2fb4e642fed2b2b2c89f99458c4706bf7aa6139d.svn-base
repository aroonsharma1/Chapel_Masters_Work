feature request: ability to iterate over unbounded ranges

I believe we should be able to iterate over unbounded ranges like this
(with the behavior undefined by the language in the event that it falls
off the top).  The fact that we can't suggests that the parser may
special-case for loops more than it ought to -- i.e., if we allow 1..
in general expression contexts, why not here?
