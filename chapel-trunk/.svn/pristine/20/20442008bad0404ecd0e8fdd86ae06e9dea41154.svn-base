bug: when a record that is defined in a proc and is unused is eliminated from the AST, its chpl__autoCopy() and chpl__initCopy() remain in the AST

This is a variation on unused-decl-in-proc-1.future that adds modules,
because I encountered the issue first in the presence of modules.

main() is not essential, it just tells the compiler which module is main.
N1, N2, N3 are minor variations on the main theme, which I believe
are not essential either.
