bug: iterators do not obey dynamic dispatch

c.itest() dispatches to itest() defined in Superclass (so it prints
"Superclass") whereas it should go to Subclass.

In the same test, I check whether dynamic dispatch works within a paren-less
function. Currently yes, it works like it should.

[Additional notes: 

* if the conditional is replaced with simply new Superclass() or new
  Subclass() it works

* if the conditional is made into a param conditional it works

* changing the order of the conditional has no effect

* Hypothesis: The compiler is trying to determine some minimal common
  type between the two branches of the expression and using that when
  resolving the iterator?
