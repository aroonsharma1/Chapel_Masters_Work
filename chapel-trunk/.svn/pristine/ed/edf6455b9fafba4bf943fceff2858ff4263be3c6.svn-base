bug: Invalid free at line 92 in Sort.chpl when --baseline is tossed.

The tuple containing the iterator classes for the zippered iterator at the end
of the _MergeSort() routine is created at the top of _MergeSort() in the
generated code (but it is not initialized there).  When the return statement on
line 92 is encountered, an attempt is made to clean up the tuple.  Since the
tuple is allocated on the stack, its entries contain garbage.

When the executable is run with valgrind, it complains appropriately.  Line
656 of Sort.c, (--no-inline) contains the invalid freeIterator() call.
