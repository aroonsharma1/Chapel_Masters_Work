bug: User-defined default constructor should override internal version.

The implementation prefers the compiler-generated default-constructor when
initializing variables of record type.  This is because the code for creating
the initializer uses the compiler-generated initializer function stored in the
"initializer" field in the ClassType rather than resolving the constructor call
normally (by name).
