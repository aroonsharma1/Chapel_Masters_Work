bug: assignment to/from an array slice where the slice has a range with a non-trivial (non-"natural") alignment results in an "array index out of bounds" message

Currently I get the following messages, depending on which lines
I comment out in the code:

modules/internal/ChapelArray.chpl:1639: error: halt reached - array index out of bounds: (1)
modules/internal/ChapelArray.chpl:1583: error: halt reached - array index out of bounds: (1)
slice-align-bug-1.chpl:NN: error: halt reached - array index out of bounds: (1)

It seems like something in the domain or array follower does not adjust
for a non-natural alignment. (Haven't we seen this before already?)
