==========================================
Creoleparser and Genshi for Chapel release
==========================================

Chapel's documentation feature, chpldoc (documented in
technotes/README.chpldoc), makes use of Creole wiki mark-up as interpreted by
the python library Creoleparser for its html generation. This library relies
on an additional python library, Genshi, for mark-up interpretation.
Running make in this directory will install these libraries.


Creoleparser can be found here:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Creoleparser

While Genshi can be found here:
http://genshi.edgewall.org/


Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to these libraries should be directed
to the Chapel team at chapel-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net, as the cause is most
likely due to Chapel's use of Creoleparser and not the library code itself.
