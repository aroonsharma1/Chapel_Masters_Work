bug: multi-locale strings assigned by reference

Wide strings are implemented with references.  This bug will hopefully be fixed
when strings are overhauled to use a wrapper record.

bug: .locale on array string elements returns wrong locale

This is an interesting test that I bumped into on accident.  It seems
that when applying .locale to a string element of an array, the locale
on which the string value was assigned (or on which the RHS lived?) is
returned rather than the locale of the array element.  This suggests
either that a string copy is not being done or that our string references
(which Steve says are a special case) are getting corrupted somehow.

It'll be interesting to see whether Sam's recent string copy work will
fix this test.
