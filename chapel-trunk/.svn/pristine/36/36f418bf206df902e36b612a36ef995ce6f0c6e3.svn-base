bug: Statically-typed variable declaration disables dynamic dispatch

When statically-typing the declaration of a variable that will
dynamically be a subclass, we seem to dispatch to the static type's
iterator rather than the dynamic type's.  You can see this in this
program by removing the type declaration on 'c'.

Happily, this behavior seems to be specific to iterators.
