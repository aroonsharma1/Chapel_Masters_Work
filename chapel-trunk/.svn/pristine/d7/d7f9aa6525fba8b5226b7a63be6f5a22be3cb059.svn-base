bug: 'sync' and 'single' should be allowed only on scalar types

This is our current thinking, and Brad's rationale for it: Imagine we
allowed 'sync' on aggregate types. Then, when is the full/empty bit
set for a multiplicity of values?  When accessing any of them?  Only
when accessing one of them?  How is the bookkeeping done?  Combined
with a lack of compelling use cases.

"Scalar" excludes string and complex.
