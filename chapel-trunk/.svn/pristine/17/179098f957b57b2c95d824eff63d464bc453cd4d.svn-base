bug: Parameter type name resolves to punned module name.

This test case fails because it contains use-before def of a class (type) name
and there is a module name (that of the test itself) which matches the desired
type name.
If either the type or the module is renamed, the test succeeds.
The fix most likely involves using context to filter the kind of symbol the name
represents.

Hint: Put a breakpoint on line 266 of scopeResolve.cpp.  This gets you close to
the point of failure.
