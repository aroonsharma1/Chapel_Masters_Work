# USAGE:
#
# Current notes on triage results, sorted into the following categories:
#
# * cases that are assigned and should be fixed (ideally during the coming
#   week)
#
# * cases that are causing noise regularly in testing, sorted by
#   approximate priority
#
# * cases that were once flagged as causing regular noise, but don't seem
#   so bad currently
#
# * cases that are not familiar, but have caused noise -- these are
#   noted so that if they happen again, we can move them up to an
#   earlier session and recognize a slower pattern over a longer
#   period of time
#
# * regular failures that someone might look at as part of their triage week
#
# The path to each test with intermittent behavior should appear here, so
# it can be grepped for. Except if a lot of test fail for the identical
# reason or in the same directory, a wildcard is more appropriate.
# The convention here is to include just the path, without test/ or .chpl.
# The date of the most recent note is also useful, with "ongoing"
# if appropriate.

darwin-gnu and darwin-clang non-deterministic compiler failures
---------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few classes of these failures during compilation that seem
to be non-deterministic based on only 2 nights of testing.  The most
common is an internal error and the next most common was an 'invalid
where clause' error.  The others only had 1-2 instances.  In order of
number of occurrences:

- error: internal failure MIS0355 chpl Version 1.8.0.-999
- invalid where clause
- compiler seg fault
- timedexec: target program died with signal 10, without coredump
- error: Initializing parameter 'ret' to value not known at compile time
- error: unresolved call '_if_fn7()'
- resolution error (unresolved call '_fill(int(64), 2*int(64))')
- warning: whole array assignment has been serialized
- error: internal failure EXP3124 chpl Version 1.8.0.-999
- error: internal failure EXP0244 chpl Version 1.8.0.-999


darwin-dnum non-deterministic timeout
-------------------------------------
[Error matching program output for domains/sungeun/assoc/stress (compopts: 1, execopts: 2)]


time out (possible gasnet race condition/deadlock)
--------------------------------------------------

everything (12/9/13, 12/13/13).  It should run in ~10s for segment
everything, so it's clear something is stuck.  Tried running in a
loop, but can't seem to recreate in several hours.  Might have compile
with -g to catch it, which will make the backtrace less useful.


numa testing non-determinism
----------------------------
sungeun: I believe this test pushes the stack size limit and gets
lucky sometimes.  I've left the entry in the REGRESSIONS file for now.
[Error matching program output for release/examples/benchmarks/lulesh/test3DLulesh (compopts: 1, execopts: 3)]


nondeterministic seg fault (hilde)
----------------------------------
[Error matching program output for classes/figueroa/RecordDestructor1b]

This failed during baseline testing on 12/12/13, but it will also fail
intermittently for the standard configuration.  I tried it with the
previous day's commits backed out, so I'm pretty sure it was not
caused by anything on this particular day.  FWIW, this runs clean with
valgrind.

nondet. baseline output
-----------------------
[Error matching program output for studies/amr/diffusion/level/Level_DiffusionBE_driver (compopts: 1)]

This may be related to the "XT/XC PrgEnv-cray non-deterministic
compiler internal errors (misc.cpp)" issue below, but one of the
few cases that triggers on the compute node rather than on the
front-end


=========================================================
Problems analyzed and assigned that should be fixed soon:
=========================================================

---------------------------------------------
(sungeun: Fix in test)

XT/XC PrgEnv-cray non-deterministic compiler internal errors (misc.cpp)
This shows up on cray-x?-cray-prgenv-cray.none.fifo.pthreads runs
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Determined to be a problem with CCE.  Filed bug 800520.

Also was witnessed once on linux64.gnu.fifo.pthreads with --no-local (11/24/13)

[Error matching compiler output for studies/sudoku/dinan/sudoku-smart]
(9/13/13, same warnings, don't know when it started)

Update 12/20/13: the failures are gone on chapbld01 for
  cray-xc.cray-prgenv-cray.none.fifo.pthreads.flat--linux64.gnu
Before removing this entry, need to ensure it succeeds over the weekend
on chpbld02. The following log file had 98 of those failures on 12/14:

pthread mutex lock assertion failed (after 22303, unassigned)

[Error matching program output for parallel/sync/diten/returnSync]
> returnSync_real: pthread_mutex_lock.c:62: __pthread_mutex_lock: Assertion `mutex->__data.__owner == 0' failed.
A brief review of the source code suggests that this problem should not occur 
unless there is a problem with atomic compare-and-swap, or data corruption in 
the mutex.
Can be duplicated with --no-local; valgrind not clean.

linux64.gnu.gasnet.qthreads.none (sungeun)
------------------------------------------
7/16/13: I moved qthreads testing to chap05, and most of these
timeouts were resolved, minus test_many_domains.

Our main noisy failures currently are as follows:

  distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/jacobi.chpl
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/stress/test_many_array
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/stress/test_many_domains


After moving these tests to a slower machine (chap02->chap10) several more
timed out including the three above plus:

  distributions/jglewis/cyclicOnEvenNumLocales.chpl
  distributions/bradc/extremeBlock.chpl
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/basics/test_array_of_distributed_array2.chpl
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/slicing/test_array_slicing3.chpl
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/modules/test_module_Sort.chpl
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/modules/test_module_Norm.chpl
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/hpl (compopts: 1).chpl
  distributions/dm/t8.chpl


I don't know that it's worth tracking when these pass fail currently.
Greg looked into the execution times and found that the problem is
that their execution time is very close to the timeout and
significantly longer than fifo.  Dylan and Brad looked into the cause
and narrowed it down to privatization (e.g., if all lines other than
the domain declarations are removed from test_many_domains, the
execution time is still very high and close to the timeout), but have
not yet gotten further than that to determine what the problem is --
e.g., a busy-wait loop, excess communication, slow handling of active
messages due to not having a thread per task as in fifo, or ...?

I've deleted historical notes on this entry that seem less useful
at present.  See the archives for more detail.

----------------------------------------
(week of 07/02, still present 10/2, 10/9/12, 1/6/13, 2/1/13)

NOTES: This is a race condition that is present in the case of *all*
iteration of val iterators (e.g. domains) where the index is passed to
a function for promotion.  The reason we don't run into this more
often is because the window for races is typically very small (usually
between 2 lines of the generated code), and it's slightly larger for
--no-local for associative arrays promoted remove().  The index
variable needs to be declared outside the scope of the promoted
function so that it can be referred to.  After the iterators are
lowered, during the parallel pass, coforall blocks are converted to
nested functions that are then flattened.  The index var is an "outer
var" (declared in the outer scope), and thus is is passed by reference
to the newly unnested functions.  But because it is the index
variable, the iterator overwrites it anyways.  In the case of the var
iterator, it simply overwrites the reference with another reference.
In the case of the val iterator, it write the actual value.  Since all
tasks performing the coforall share the same memory location passed in
from the promotion wrapper,

types/range/hilde/align64
-------------------------
This test gets a false positive pass on intel and pgi it seems, for
reasons that are not clear to me (i.e., why are they behaving differently
than gcc?).  If the future should remain, a .skipif should be added to
skip it in these cases.
 
I wouldn't call the future a bug so much as a 'feature request' or
'semantic' future -- it suggests a change in the language definition
that should be considered and agreed upon rather than reflecting a way
in which the compiler is incorrect w.r.t. the language definition (as
I understand it.

This failed with 1 fewer fork on the 4th locale than expected (9/7/2013) and
passed the next time it was run.
