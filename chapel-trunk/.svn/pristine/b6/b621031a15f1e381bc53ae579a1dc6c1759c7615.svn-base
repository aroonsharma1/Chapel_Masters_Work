bug: We would like atomic variables to be passed by reference.

We would like atomic variables to be passed by reference when returned from a LF
iterator. Currently, this value is copied between the leader, and the follower. This
(obviously) causes race conditions when trying to use an atomic in the leader to
create a lock on some shared access between all the followers. You can see that the
atomic variable is indeed being copied (if you don't believe that's the reason we get
this output) by uncommenting all the lines marked DEBUG in the .chpl file.
