feature request: allow explicit conversion from range(int(64)) to range(int(32))

Since we are allowed to have an explicit cast from int(64) to int(32),
it only makes sense to allow the same thing for ranges.

Alas, right now I get:
  explicit-conversion-index-type.chpl:2: error: illegal cast from range(int(64),bounded,false) to range(int(32),bounded,false)
