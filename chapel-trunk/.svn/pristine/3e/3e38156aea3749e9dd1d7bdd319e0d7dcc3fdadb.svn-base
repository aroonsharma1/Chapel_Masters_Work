Distribution Robustness Suites

This directory contains test suites designed to cover most of the
functionality that is provided by Chapel's domain maps.  The tests are
written using driver code that defines domain maps, domains and arrays
using the compile-time specified domain map.

Before adding tests to these directories, please consider if they fit
this intent.  For example, direct bug reports should probably be put
somewhere else, but it would be fine to commit code here by rewriting
the buggy code in a way to work with any domain maps.

Directory structure:

- arithmetic: for domain maps that use DefaultRectangular as a base
  (e.g., BlockDist, CyclicDist, ReplicatedDist, etc.)

- associative: for domain maps that use DefaultAssociative as a base
  (only DefaultAssociative for now)

TODO:
- sparse
