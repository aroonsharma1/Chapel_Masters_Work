bug: an exported proc that returns a record is emitted in two forms

When the compiler encounters an exported proc that returns a record, it
emits two versions of that function into the output C code.  One returns
the record directly.  The other returns void and accepts a pointer to
the record type, and the function body fills in the pointed-to record.
Unfortunately the two functions have the same name, and so the target
compiler gripes about multiple definitions of the same function with
mismatched argument profiles and return types.

The correct behavior should be to generate just one function which
(since it is exported) returns the record type.
