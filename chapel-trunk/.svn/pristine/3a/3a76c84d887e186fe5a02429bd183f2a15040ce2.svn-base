bug: de-tuple expression size mismatch

This test shows that we currently have a bug in which de-tupling a tuple
in a statement context doesn't complain if the number of LHS variables
doesn't match the tuple's size.

Notes:

* This does work in a declaration context currently, so the proposed
  error message is borrowed from that context.

* If the mismatch is in the other direction (# of LHS variables > tuple
  size) we get a so-so error message.  This might be a good clue for
  where to look when fixing this issue.
