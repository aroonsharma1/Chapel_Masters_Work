bug: Variable declarations within local blocks for types with privatized data result in seg fault or "cannot access remote data in local block" error.

This currently fails because privatization requires communication.
Specifically, chpl_localeTree which is used to fan out the privatized
data has locales for its fields.  Access to these locales require
communication which is not generated for local blocks.
