bug: compiler crashes with an assertion (details not investigated)

UPDATE: same as crash3tuple.chpl and crash4replLclsWFlds.chpl

Currently I get:

d.chpl:610: In function 'showArrLocales':
d.chpl:614: warning: whole array assignment has been serialized (see note in $CHPL_HOME/STATUS) [blah blah blah]
error: assertion error [iterator.cpp:119]
