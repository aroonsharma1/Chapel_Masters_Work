bug: param function returns variable

This show codes that we currently permit a parameter function to
return a runtime variable value -- the code compiles and executes,
returning 0.0 from the param function.  This should generate a
compile-time error message as suggested in the .good file.  

Steve and I talked about whether or not using variables in param
functions should simply be illegal but decided that there was no harm
in it per se, so long as the correct functioning of the routine did
not rely on that variable's runtime value (e.g., relying on its type
or rank in the case of an array variable would be reasonable).  This
could stand to be re-evaluated if it becomes problemsome, however.
