feature request: Would like to be able to pass strings as char* to extern procs.

For const strings defined in the called routine, this was sort-of working until
chpl__initCopy(a:string) was redefined from
    return string_copy(a); 
to
    return a;

Now it is disabled, pending checkin of David's reference-counted strings work.

Additional work may be required to get this working correctly (see
extern_string_test2.chpl), because what the called routine should see is the
address of the c_str() section of a local copy of the string to be modified.
Right now, we get the address of a chpl_string (a char*, not a char**), which
only works because chpl_strings are currently just raw char* strings.
