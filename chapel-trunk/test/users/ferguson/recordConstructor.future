A record with a zero-argument constructor
should perhaps have the zero-argument constructor
called automatically. Or at least the spec should
make a note of this behavior (as other notable
languages - C++ - would do it with a default constructor).

Right now, this program gives:

In doit
R constructor
15
In doit
15
R destructor
R destructor

At the moment (10/13/2011), the spec says
"If any user-defined constructors are supplied,
 the default initializer cannot be called directly."

I would take that to mean that if there are any
user-supplied constructors, the declaration
 var r:R;

would either result in an error or call a
no-arguments constructor.
