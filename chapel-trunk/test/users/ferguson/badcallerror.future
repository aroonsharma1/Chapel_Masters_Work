badcallerror.chpl:3: error: type mismatch in assignment from chpl__fcf_type_void_int64_t to int(64)

does not convey to me that the problem is that I actually forgot
to call the function.

It would probably help to improve the "chpl__fcf_type_void_int64_t"
to be something more evocative of a function type
(ie fcf probably stands for "First Class Function", but that
 is solidly esoteric)
