bug: parallel zippered iteration does no size/shape checking

bradc: The problem is that our parallel leader/follower interface does
not support a size check.

Note that the error is detected if the roles are reversed, i.e. a smaller
array is assigned to a larger one.  The bounds performing the loop for
assignment are probably determined by the array on the left side.

This might mean that "array index out of bounds" is the wrong error, since
in this example B(4) would never be accessed.  Perhaps the compatibility 
of the domains needs to be verified before the assignment occurs?
