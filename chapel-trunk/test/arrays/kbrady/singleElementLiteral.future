feature request: Change the single element array syntax to [x,]

The current syntax for single element array literals can be a source of
confusion. For example when used with a for loop the thought can be to write
	for i in [1..2] do
		writeln(i);
which will return 
	1..2
rather than the expected
	1
	2

By changing the syntax to be [x,] it becomes clear as to what is happening.
This also brings arrays into line with single element tuples - making things
more consistent across the language. In addition, there may be gains in
simplifying the parser with respect to the shorthand form of forall loops.
