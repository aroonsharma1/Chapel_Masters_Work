This test is intended to make sure compiler performance testing isn't missing
any passes. This will catch if passes are renamed/removed/reordered, etc. 

Unfortunately it's hard to automate adding/reordering/removing passes. At least
for anything even a little complex. How do you automatically tell the
difference between if a pass was removed and a new one was added vs simple
renaming.

When a pass is changed the compilerPerformance.perfkeys has to be updated. The
.dat files have to be updated and the .graph files have to be updated. 

For now I think it makes sense just give me a heads up when a pass changes and
I'll take care of it. Passes don't change often so this shouldn't be a big
deal.
