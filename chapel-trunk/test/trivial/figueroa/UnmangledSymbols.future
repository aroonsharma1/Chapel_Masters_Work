bug: name mangling

Was:

bug: some symbol names are erroneously not mangled in the generated C code

for example, reserved words in C that are not reserved words in Chapel, symbol
names that begin with "chpl_" (which are reserved for the Chapel runtime),
extra reserved words in the various compilers
and a multitude of symbol names exported from the standard C library.
One area that requires special consideration is concatenation of symbol names, 
such as when mangling enums.
