bug: const domains modifiable via function calls

This test shows that while we've made .domain a const
function, the domain can still be modified if the
.domain is passed to a function call.  This should
generate an error since a non-lvalue is being passed
to a function that takes it by reference and modifies
it.  Thanks to Steve for thinking of this issue.
