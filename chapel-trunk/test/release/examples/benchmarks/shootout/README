Chapel Computer Language Benchmarks Game Codes
==============================================

This directory contains Chapel versions of the Computer Language
Benchmarks Game programs (http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/)
written in Chapel.  In these versions, we strive for a combination of
elegant use of Chapel and performance.  Most of these codes are
written for serial or parallel single-locale (shared-memory)
execution, following the lead of the competition.

At present, this directory contains the following codes:

    binarytrees.chpl    : Allocates and deallocates many, many binary trees
    chameneosredux.chpl : Simulates meetings between color-changing Chameneos
    nbody.chpl          : Performs an n-body simulation of the Jovian planets
    spectralnorm.chpl   : Calculates the spectral norm of an infinite matrix
    threadring.chpl     : Passes a token between a large number of threads

Over time, we plan to create versions of all the benchmarks and to
enter Chapel into the competition.  Draft versions of other benchmarks
that have not yet been promoted to the release can be found in our SVN
repository under the test/studies/shootout/ directory.

The provided Makefile can be used to compile the programs, or they can
be run in correctness or performance modes using the Chapel testing
system (see $CHPL_HOME/util/sub_test).

Note that chameneosredux.chpl has non-deterministic output.
