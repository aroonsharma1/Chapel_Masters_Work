Module: chpldoc
   proc commented(val: int(64)): string
      
  Multiline comments found before a method are associated with that method
  as long as there are no code blocks between them.


   proc stub(val): bool
      
  The method can be a stub and still output its comment


   proc uncommented()

   Module: chpldoc.Defined
      
  If the source code defines a module, it can also have a comment associated
  with it

      Class: Foo
         
    And classes can display their comments, too
  
         var a: int(64)
            
      Including the comments associated with their fields
    
         proc getA(): int(64)
            
      And class specific methods
    

         inherited from object

      Class: Bar
         
    If a class inherits from another class, those fields, methods, and their
    comments are output in both the super and the subclass
  
         proc setA(newVal: int(64))

         inherited from Foo
            var a: int(64)
               
      Including the comments associated with their fields
    
            proc getA(): int(64)
               
      And class specific methods
    


         inherited from object
