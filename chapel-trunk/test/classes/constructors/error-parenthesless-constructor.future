semantic: disallow parenthesis-less constructors

Brad and Vass feel that Chapel should not allow constructor methods to
be declared without parentheses.

Note: in the current implementation one can write both constructors
(both with no arguments) at the same time. Then when invoking
new classname(), the compiler finds that call ambiguous.
