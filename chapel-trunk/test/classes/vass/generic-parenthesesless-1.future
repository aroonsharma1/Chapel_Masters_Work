bug: compiler crashes with seg fault

Currently I get this:
  error: seg fault [misc.cpp:270]

Note: this crash is intermittent. It seems to be sensitive to
whether there is ': int' after 'param x' and whether
the compiler is run under start_test/gdb/command line.

See also other generic-parenthesesless-* tests
as variations that may trigger the crash.
