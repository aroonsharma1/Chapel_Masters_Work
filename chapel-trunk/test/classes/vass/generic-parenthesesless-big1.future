bug: compiler reports an error incorrectly

Currently I am getting:
  generic-parenthesesless-big1.chpl:11: error: actual type is unknown or generic

This is the same as generic-parenthesesless-3.future.

This test contains a few variations at once.
See other generic-parenthesesless-*.chpl for smaller examples.
