bug: Bulk transfer optimization does not work for Block distributed rank changed arrays with --disableAliasedBulkTransfer=false

Bulk transfer for Block distribution does not work for rank changed
arrays for which the last (right-most) dimension is a collapsed
dimension.

The --disableAliasedBulkTransfer config was added as a work around to
this bug.  When it is fixed, it should be removed as should the
.execopts file.
