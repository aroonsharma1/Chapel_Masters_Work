bug: Shadowed functions from extern #include causes error in generated header

Right now this generates a compile time error by gcc. 
We would like Chapel to check to see if there is any shadowing and 
error out before it goes through all the work of compiling it to C.
The errors are: 
error: conflicting types for 'foo'
error: previous declaration of 'foo' was here
