performance: coforalls behave as expected, creating a single task on each locale.  It would be nice to optimize this case so that no new task is created on the starting locale.

Discovered by the usage in Block and Cyclic distributions, as it affects the
number of tasks created when dataParIgnoreRunningTasks=false.
