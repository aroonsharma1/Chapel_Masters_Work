feature request: Use the C complex types and math libraries instead of implementing our own

We currently implement our complex types as a pair of floating point numbers,
but C99 added a complex type that we could be using instead.  This would give
us easier access to the C math libraries for complex types.  Right now, we
implement our own complex math routines and sometimes they are not quite right.
This test demonstrates one case we get wrong.
