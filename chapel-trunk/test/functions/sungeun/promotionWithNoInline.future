bug: Using --no-inline does not always produce correct code (promotion wrapper can return records that are allocated on the stack)

When compiled with --no-inline (and run under valgrind), this test
shows an example of the promotion wrapper combined with the coerce
wrapper returning a the address of a record that is on the stack.  I'm
not exactly sure which part is to blame, but when both functions are
inlined the data gets put on the heap as it should be.

This causes non-deterministic time outs and failures for baseline
testing.  For the time being, we will disable inlining for baseline
testing.
