bug: passing enums to param uint args causes problems in where clauses

This test shows that passing enums to uint param arguments can cause
problems in where clauses.  In particular, compiling the attached test
results in an assertion error in this where clause.  In other cases,
I've seen warnings of illegal where clauses (in particular when adding
where clauses to comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=) in the internal
modules in the event that enums are passed to them.  This latter
behavior was particularly exacerbated by the tests:

         [Error matching compiler output for types/enum/diten/paramenums]
         [Error matching compiler output for types/enum/sungeun/test_foldEnumOp]
         [Error matching compiler output for users/brodtkorb/coercionQuestion]
