bug: sync variable is deleted prematurely when passed by ref and used in 'begin'

See:
  autodestroy-with-begin-1.future


autodestroy-with-begin-3.chpl:

It is a variation on autodestroy-with-begin-1.chpl that has a lot more
intermediate functions/calls, declares additional sync variables along the
way, and has an additional 'begin' that's invoked from the original 'begin'.
This is to ensure that the fix to this bug works when the declaration
of a sync variable and the begin where it's used are far apart.

Each of the 3 sync variables suffers from the title bug.
Valgrind gives me 3 errors.
But if I pipe its output, somehow I only get 1 error.
