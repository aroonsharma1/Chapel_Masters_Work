feature requst: ability to overload ChapelBase.chpl operators in user code

This is a copy of the original test_override_operators.chpl which I'm
preserving in deference to David's original intent which was to permit
the user to override built-in operators like ==() and have them be
chosen over the built-ins due to being closer in scope.  This test
broke with the commmit that is checking it in because comparisons
between enums currently dispatch to ==(int,int) and the call became
ambiguous since neither definition of ==() was closer than the other.
