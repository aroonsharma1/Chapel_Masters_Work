feature request: allow implicit conversions from u/int(8) and u/int(16) to real(32).

What was the ambiguity that Steve was trying to avoid
by not supporting int(8)->real(32) conversions?

Is the ambiguity arising in the call +(i,i) where i:int(8) and it is
unclear whether int(32) addition or real(32) addition is more specific?

If so (or similar), why doesn't the same problem occur
with int(32) addition vs. real(64) addition?
