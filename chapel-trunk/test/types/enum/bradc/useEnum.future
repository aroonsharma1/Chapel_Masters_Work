feature request: enums should be usable like modules

This test captures a desire that I have to 'use' an enum like a module
in order to refer to its symbols directly and without going through
the enum type name.  This seems like a reasonable thing to want
(especially coming from C) and not a particularly difficult thing to
implement.
