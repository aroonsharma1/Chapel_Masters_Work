feature request: allow positive enum constants to be implicitly convertible to unsigned ints of sufficient size

Basically, we'd like enum constants to be like params, implying that
they should convert to any type that can represent them.

But at the moment I get:

enum-to-uint-param-1.chpl:3: error: type mismatch in assignment from e to uint(8)
