bug: indices not treated as const

This test shows that const-ness checking is not done properly for
iterators generating non-var/ref return values.  It was originally
filed as though this was a language-level decision; since then, we've
determined (wisely, I believe) that it should be a function of the
iterator's return intent, not the language itself.
