ferguson/mandelbrot2-opt:
  Uses complex numbers for computation, determines all the bits within each
  iteration as opposed to determining them individually, writes to a file
  mandelbrot.pbm and so cannot be submitted to the Shootout contest.

ferguson/mandelbrot-stdout:
  Does the same thing as mandelbrot2-opt except writes to stdout instead of a
  file.
  
ferguson/mandelbrot-opt2:
  Does the same thing as mandelbrot2-opt, except writes to the file as bits are
  determined rather than all at once.  Also cannot be submitted to the
  Shootout contest.


jacobnelson/mandelbrot-complex:
  Serial, uses complex numbers for computation, writes using the C function
  putchar

jacobnelson/mandelbrot-dist:
  Also uses complex numbers, and the C function putchar.  Difference is the use
  of parallelization, as well as storing the data using distributions and 
  booleans, which are then translated to uint(8)s.

jacobnelson/mandelbrot-fancy:
  Uses a distribution to improve load balance, as well as computing with reals
  instead of complex numbers.  However, the distribution causes it to run out
  of memory when running the full problem size on machines with a small number
  of cores so it is not run as a performance test.


lydia/mandelbrot-no-dist:
  The same as mandelbrot-fancy, minus the distribution so that the program does
  not run out of memory.  Currently the fastest version that outputs to stdout,
  although(/because) it uses putchar instead of pure Chapel I/O.
