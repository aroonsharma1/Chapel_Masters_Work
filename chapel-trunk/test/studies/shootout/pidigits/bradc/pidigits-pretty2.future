feature request: init/teardown hooks for extern types (?)

This test has a serious memory leak due to the implementation of the *
operator in GMPops.chpl.  A nice way to fix this would be to have
arbitrary init/teardown hooks for extern types.  Alternatively, we
could wrap all GMP types in a record and implement appropriate
constructors/destructors for the records that would "do the right
thing."  Or perhaps there are other ways of addressing this that I'm
not anticipating (like guaranteed use of a steal optimization / move
constructor?)
