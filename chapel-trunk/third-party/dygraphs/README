dygraphs README for Chapel
==========================

This copy of dygraphs is being released with Chapel for convenience and
uses a snapshot obtained at: 

  http://dygraphs.com

It is used to generate graphs of our performance data and to display
previously created graphs at http://chapel.sourceforge.net/perf/

Any problems with viewing or using these graphs should be directed to
the Chapel team at chapel-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net, as the cause is
most likely due to Chapel's use of dygraphs and not the library code
itself.
