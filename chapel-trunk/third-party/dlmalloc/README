dlmalloc for Chapel release
===========================

This copy of dlmalloc is being released with Chapel for convenience
and is a snapshot of dlmalloc version 2.8.5 obtained from Doug Lea at:
http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to dlmalloc should be
directed to the Chapel team at chapel-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net, as
the cause is most likely due to Chapel's use of dlmalloc and not the
dlmalloc library itself.

The structure of this directory is as follows:

./
  Makefile        : a Makefile to help build dlmalloc for Chapel's use
  README          : this file
  build/          : dlmalloc object files are stored in the subdirectory:
    $CHPL_PLATFORM-$CHPL_COMPILER/
  include/        : contains the dlmalloc header file
  lib/            : the dlmalloc library is stored in the subdirectory:
    $CHPL_PLATFORM-$CHPL_COMPILER/
  src/            : contains the dlmalloc source file and a Makefile
