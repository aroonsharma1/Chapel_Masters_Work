%\vspace{-1ex}
We present a binary framework which decompiles the input binary into LLVM IR, allowing the application of source-level complex transformations and advanced symbolic execution strategies on executables and enabling functional source-code recovery. In future, we plan to extend our framework for various platform-specific optimizations.
%Our x86 results show that SecondWrite accelerates unoptimized binaries by 27\% on average for our benchmarks, and maintains the performance of already optimized binaries without any custom optimizations.
